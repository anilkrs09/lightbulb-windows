* Is there a YAML lint extension the end user can add?  I know YAML support by Red Hat is there.. 
Test these a bit and put a solution so users don't have issues... 
Add to exercise 1.1 (and anywhere else we're committing yaml)

* Is there a better differentiation for defaults/vars than what I have in exercise 1.5?  Not certain I'm happy with what's there...

* Get final git example pushed to the admin-playbooks repo as public on gitlab (for people's reference) 

* Instead of having to enter ptr_zone_cidr and ptr_zone_name, have it build this from the VPC...

* Update network design so workstation is the single point of entry.  All other IPs could then be on private subnet.  

* Test deploying 2 students and make certain the inventory is only the student's specific hosts.  I have a feeling it will include ALL students, but need to test.. 

* Pre-install tower and leave the lab for reference? 
  * Note - Expectation is we follow the Tower lab for it's install/overview
  * Need to update the job template lab to be specific to our Windows example 
* Refactor manage-ec2-instances.  Really repetitive... Maybe the role should provision X hosts for X role.  And then be run 4 times with different inputs? 

* If servers are shutdown and then restarted (or one is reprovisioned), it does not correct the DNS settings.  They will remain pointed to the old IP address

* Should we show differences between kerberos and credssp auth? 

* It would be nice if the text file containing your ansible inventory was on the workstation desktop.  Easier to copy/paste an admin password if needed... 

Advanced Labs / Use Cases: 
* Patch Management 
* DSC Modules - and what they can do (maybe combined with ci/cd example?)
* Example of self-service app teams?  Allowing them to stop/start services.... Stop/start servers... 
   -> Showing RBAC by using restricted 'ops#' user who can only execute against a small subset of hosts using a specific playbook
* Add a lab in Tower showing ad-hoc commands (similar to command line)
* CI/CD Lab? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/dsccicd?

* Every time we run the gitlab post config role it is going to reset the admin/root user.  We should find a way around that... 

* The student inventory should be updated for s#tower.  It's setup to target ec2-user.  Of course the student doesn't have an ssh key for ec2-user...  Should probably have it set to student# with the users_password
